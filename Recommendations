Recomendations:
This is a list of recommendations to make this project better 
(UI, UX, Performance, Security, Architecture, Bug fix, New Feature, ...etc )

// Please make your recommendations as clear as possible with only a few sentences 

1. Login error message is wrong (not really).

2. Login email and password should not be hardcoded

3. No signup option

4. Code should be written according to best style practices

5. Login box should have a margin-top

6. Initial validation should happen in the front-end, should be remodeled in order to take advantage of the 
existing HTML validation attributes before making any requests.

7. Make change password button work.

8. Since this is not a realistic project there is no further editing I would do unless I had the time
to rewrite all of it, there is no real back-end without a database...
